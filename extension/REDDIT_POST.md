## Post for r/peptides

**Title:** Built an AI research assistant for peptides - looking for beta testers

**Body:**

Hey r/peptides,

I've been lurking here for a while and got tired of digging through old posts, PubMed abstracts, and random forums to find reliable peptide info. So I built something to help.

**Peptide AI** is a research assistant that:

- Answers questions about peptides with actual citations (PubMed, not just "bro science")
- Shows evidence quality badges (🟢 Strong / 🟡 Moderate / 🔴 Limited) so you know how much to trust the research
- Has a "skeptic mode" that's honest about what we DON'T know
- Covers BPC-157, TB-500, Semaglutide, Tirzepatide, GHK-Cu, and many more

**What I need:**

Beta testers who'll actually use it and give honest feedback. Not looking for "yeah looks cool" - I want to know what sucks, what's missing, what's confusing.

**What you get:**

- Free access during beta
- Direct line to the developer (me) to request features
- Chrome extension that highlights peptide mentions on Reddit

**Try it:** [Link to app]

**Chrome Extension:** [Link to extension if hosted]

## Post for r/Nootropics

**Title:** Made an AI that actually cites research - beta testers wanted

**Body:**

Tired of getting "just take X bro" advice without any actual evidence? Same.

Built an AI research tool that:

- Covers peptides like Semax, Selank, and more
- Has a "skeptic mode" when you want the real truth

Looking for beta testers from this community. Want honest feedback on what works and what doesn't.

Free during beta. Link: [URL]

**Body:**

Quick pitch: I made an AI that actually cites its sources for peptide research. Shows you whether something has real human trials or just "promising rat studies."

Features:
- Evidence quality ratings
- PubMed citations
- Stack recommendations with synergy/conflict warnings
- Chrome extension for quick lookups

Looking for beta testers. Free access, just want your feedback.
