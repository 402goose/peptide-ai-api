# Peptide AI - Strategic Vision

> **The trusted research companion for the peptide community — powered by science, enriched by real experiences, monetized through the entire user journey.**

## The Opportunity

### Market Reality
The peptide market is exploding. GLP-1 agonists (Ozempic, Wegovy) have gone mainstream. BPC-157 and TB-500 are discussed openly on TikTok and Reddit. Yet there's no trusted, comprehensive resource that bridges:

- **Academic research** (scattered across PubMed, often paywalled)
- **Real user experiences** (fragmented on Reddit, forums, social media)
- **Practical guidance** (protocols, sourcing, safety)
- **Chinese research** (cutting-edge studies locked behind language barriers)

**We fill this gap.**

### Why Now
1. **Regulatory tailwinds**: FDA's crackdown on compounding pharmacies is pushing users to seek reliable information
2. **Social proof era**: TikTok/Instagram peptide journey creators are driving massive awareness
3. **AI inflection**: RAG technology makes domain-specific AI actually good now
4. **Data moat timing**: First mover with structured user journey data wins

## What We're Building

### The Product
An AI-powered peptide research platform that:

1. **Answers any peptide question** with sourced, balanced information from research AND user experiences
2. **Tracks user journeys** — protocols, doses, symptoms, outcomes — building the largest structured peptide dataset
3. **Connects users to trusted sources** (monetized through strategic affiliate partnerships)
4. **Empowers creators** to share their journeys and earn

### Positioning: Research Platform, Not Medical Advice
We position as a **research information platform** — not a wellness tool or medical device. This is intentional:
- Avoids FDA medical device classification
- Reduces liability exposure
- Allows honest discussion of research-stage compounds
- Users understand they must consult healthcare providers

---

## The Moat Strategy

### 1. User Journey Data (Primary Moat)
Every journey tracked = proprietary training data:
- Protocols that work (and don't)
- Dose-response relationships
- Side effect patterns by demographics
- Stack combinations and outcomes

**No one else has this structured, at scale.** Reddit has fragments. Forums have noise. We have clean, enriched, queryable data.

### 2. Chinese Research Curation
Chinese peptide research is 2-3 years ahead in some areas. We:
- Ingest from ChinaXiv (OAI-PMH) and Chinese journals
- Translate and contextualize
- Make it accessible to English speakers first

### 3. Creator Network Effects
Peptide journey creators on TikTok/Instagram become our distribution:
- They use the platform to track + share journeys
- Their audience follows them to us
- We provide export tools optimized for content creation
- Affiliate earnings keep them engaged

### 4. Trust Through Transparency
Unlike black-box wellness chatbots:
- We show sources for every claim
- We distinguish research vs. anecdotal
- We're honest about uncertainty
- We include appropriate disclaimers

| Pro | $19/mo | Unlimited queries, full journey analytics, export |
| Pro+ Ship | $49/mo | Pro + monthly peptide shipment credit |
| Creator | $29/mo | Pro + creator tools, enhanced affiliate |

**Target**: 100K users, 10% conversion = 10K paying = $190K MRR

#### 2. Affiliate Revenue (Secondary)
Strategic partnerships with trusted vendors:
- **In-product**: Subtle recommendations when users ask about sourcing
- **Email sequences**: Post-signup nurture with vendor education
- **Pixel attribution**: Track conversions across the journey
- **Creator splits**: Creators earn on their audience's purchases

**Model**: 15-25% commission on peptide sales, 5% on equipment/supplies

#### 3. Creator Program (Tertiary)
- Take a cut of creator earnings (platform fee)
- Premium creator tools and analytics
- Brand partnership facilitation (JoinBrands integration)

### Unit Economics Target
- CAC: $30 (creator-driven acquisition is cheap)
- LTV: $300+ (12mo retention, affiliate adds 30%)
- LTV:CAC > 10:1

## Why This Team / Why Now

### Unique Advantages
1. **Existing peptide manufacturer relationships** — direct access to quality product for Pro+ Ship tier
2. **China factory connections** — competitive unit economics on physical fulfillment
3. **Technical capability** — RAG + vector search + multi-language is hard; we've built it

### Timing
- Post-Ozempic cultural moment
- Pre-regulation window
- AI capabilities just crossed the threshold
- No dominant player yet

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Regulatory crackdown | Research platform positioning, clear disclaimers, no medical claims |
| Liability | Strong ToS, research-only framing, user acknowledgment flows |
| Affiliate conflicts of interest | Transparent disclosure, quality vendor curation, separate info/commerce layers |
| AI hallucination | RAG architecture, source citation, safety filters, human review for edge cases |
| Market not ready | Start with hardcore community (Reddit migrators), expand as mainstream catches up |

## The Big Picture

We're not just building a chatbot. We're building:

1. **The knowledge layer** for an emerging health category
2. **The data asset** that compounds with every user
3. **The distribution network** through aligned creators
4. **The commerce rails** for trusted transactions

First mover with the data moat wins. The peptide market is $30B+ and growing 8% annually. We capture 1% of information-seeking users → $300M+ opportunity.
