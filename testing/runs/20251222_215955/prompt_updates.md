# PROMPT UPDATES DOCUMENT

## 1. Current Issues Identified
- **Lack of Detailed Information:** Users are requesting more detailed dosing protocols, stacking recommendations, and side effect management.
  - Affected Personas: Jake, Sarah, Marcus, Jennifer, Alex, Mike
- **Evidence and Validation Concerns:** Users desire more robust citations, transparency about research quality, and user testimonials.
  - Affected Personas: David, Mike
- **Interactive Experience Lacking:** Users want a more engaging, personalized exploration of peptide synergies and protocols.
  - Affected Personas: Elena

## 2. Proposed System Prompt Additions
- **Addition 1: Dosing Protocols**
  ```
  "For specific peptide protocols, including dosing, timing, and stacking, ensure to provide detailed, evidence-backed options. Where appropriate, include user testimonials and case studies to support these protocols."
  ```
  - **Rationale:** This addition addresses the need for more comprehensive guidance on dosing and stacking, along with real-world validations.
  
- **Addition 2: Evidence Presentation**
  ```
  "For each claim about peptide benefits and mechanisms, include direct citations from studies. Clearly distinguish between human and animal research, and discuss the limitations of each study."
  ```
  - **Rationale:** Adding this ensures transparency and increases trust in the information provided.

## 3. Proposed System Prompt Modifications
- **Modification 1: Introduction of Peptides**
  - **Before:** "Provide a clear overview of the peptide and its potential benefits."
  - **After:** "Provide a clear, evidence-backed overview of the peptide, its potential benefits, and any associated risks. Include a comparison with similar peptides where relevant."
  - **Rationale:** The modified text emphasizes evidence and comparative analysis, addressing user concerns about safety and alternatives.

## 4. Response Mode Adjustments
- **Balanced Mode:** 
  - Ensure responses in this mode blend evidence presentation with practical advice, suitable for general users.
  
- **Skeptic Mode:**
  - Focus on highlighting the limitations of studies, providing more critical analysis, and maintaining a cautious tone regarding unproven benefits.
  
- **Actionable Mode:**
  - Prioritize providing clear, step-by-step protocols with immediate applicability, along with potential cost-effective options.

## 5. Citation/Source Improvements
- **Improvement 1: Citation Format**
  ```
  "When citing sources, list them in a numbered format at the end of the response, with links to original studies or summaries where possible."
  ```
  - **Rationale:** This format makes it easier for users to verify claims and research further.

- **Improvement 2: Evidence Badges**
  ```
  "Implement an 'Evidence Badge' system indicating the strength of evidence (e.g., 'Animal Studies', 'Human Trials', 'Meta-Analysis')."
  ```
  - **Rationale:** Helps users quickly assess the reliability of the information.

## 6. Persona-Specific Adaptations
- **Adaptation Strategy:**
  - Implement a user detection system based on initial questions, key phrases, or a short onboarding quiz to tailor responses. For example:
    - If a user asks about "stacking protocols," it's likely they are a bodybuilder or advanced user.
    - Questions about "side effects" and "safety" could indicate a cautious or health-anxious persona.
  
- **Adaptation Example:**
  ```
  "For bodybuilder_advanced personas, emphasize detailed stacking protocols and timing. For anxious_cautious personas, focus on safety, side effects, and when to seek medical advice."
  ```
  - **Rationale:** Tailoring responses increases relevance and satisfaction for different user types.

With these updates, Peptide AI can better address user needs, enhancing both satisfaction and trust in the platform.
